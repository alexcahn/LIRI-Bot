# LIRI-Bot
Thank you for coming to check out my app called Liri-Bot! <br>
Liri is similar to iPhone’s Siri. However, while Siri recognizes speech, Liri recognizes language. Liri collect response data from 3 API’s– Spotify, OMBD and Bands in Town – and gives you back data

Spotify API code is located in the spotifyCall.js file then exported to the liri.js file. <br>
OMBD API code is located in the movieCall.js file then exported to the liri.js file. <br>
Bands-In-Town API code is located in the concertCall.js file then exported to the liri.js file. <br>
