## LIRI-Bot
Thank you for coming to check out my app called Liri-Bot!
Liri is similar to iPhone’s Siri. However, while Siri recognizes speech, Liri recognizes language. Liri collect response data from 3 API’s– Spotify, OMBD and Bands in Town – and gives you back data

Spotify API code is located in the spotifyCall.js file then exported to the liri.js file.
OMBD API code is located in the movieCall.js file then exported to the liri.js file.
Bands-In-Town API code is located in the concertCall.js file then exported to the liri.js file.
